					<a href="http://portals.apache.org/pluto/">Pluto</a> is a project at
          Apache Portals (http://portals.apache.org/pluto) that provides the
          reference implementation of the Java Portlet Specification. The first
          version of this specification is available as
          <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=168">JSR 168</a>.
          The pluto project contains two parts: the portlet container and
          a simple test portal driver. This document is about how to use the
          pluto portlet container and replace the sample portal driver with your
          own portal.

				<p>
          Figure 1 depicts a portal's basic architecture. The portal's web
          application processes the client request, retrieves the portlets on
          the user's current page, and then calls the portlet container to
          retrieve each portlet's content. The portal accesses the Portlet
          Container by using the Portlet Container Invoker API. This interface
          represents the main interface of the portlet container supporting
          request-base methods to call portlets from a portal's point of view.
          The Container Provider SPI (Service Provider Interface) is a callback
          interface of the Portlet Container which needs to be implemented by
          the portal to get portal related information, the container cannot
          know about, like URL creation. Finally, the portlet container calls
          all portlets via the Portlet API.
        </p>

        <p>
          The portlet container provides the runtime environment for the
          portlets. It is a core component of each portal, requires knowledge
          about the portal itself and has a need to reuse common code of the
          portal. Due to these requirements the pluto portlet container is built
          in a manner that completely separates the container from every other
          portal component. Said that, the portlet container is a standalone
          component that can be embedded in any portal by complying with the
          requirements of the portlet container, such as implementing all SPIs.
          The interfaces of the portlet container and its internal components
          are described in more detail in the next paragraphs.

          The Portlet Container Invoker API, also called entrance point, is the
          main calling interface of a portlet container. It combines the
          lifecycle (init, destroy) of a portlet container as well as the
          request based calling methods (processAction, render). Due to its
          nature of calling a portlet in the end, the method signature looks
          similar to the main portlet interface of the Portlet API except that
          a portlet identifier needs to be passed additionally. With this
          additional parameter the container is able to determine the portlet
          and call it accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides of the application programming interfaces the portlet
          container can be instrumented by providing different implementations
          through service provider interfaces. Therefore, the reference
          implementation introduces a concept called Container Services.
          This concept will be described in more detail in a later chapter.

        <p>
          This section covers in detail how the portal can call the container
          and which SPIs needs to be implemented by the portal in order to
          re-use pluto. The portal calls the pluto container via the portlet
          container entrance point and needs to provide implementations for the
          SPIs container services and the portlet object model.
        </p>
        
        <a name="3.1 Portlet Container Entrance Point"></a><div class="section"><h3>3.1 Portlet Container Entrance Point</h3>
          <p>
            The portlet container entrance point
            <code>org.apache.pluto.PortletContainer</code>, is the main
            interface between the portal's framework / aggregation and the
            portlet environment. This interface is used to call the portlet
            environment and execute portlets. It doesn't match exactly to the
            Portlet API methods (init, processAction, render, destroy) but
            generalizes the interface wherever possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            The entrance point has methods with different scopes:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Lifecycle methods are called only <b>once</b> (init/shutdown).
                <p>These methods are normally called directly from the service interfaces.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                Request-based methods are called for each request, but only
                once for all portlets (portletLoad).
                <p>These methods must be called before the page aggregation
                actually starts and after aggregating the page, affecting all
                portlets being rendered on the page. Currently the only method
                in this category is portletLoad that ensures that the portlet is
                loaded and initialized before the request processing starts.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                Request-based methods are called for each request and for
                each portlet (processPortletAction, renderPortlet).
                <p>These methods are normally called during the page aggregation
                as each portlet is being rendered.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
					<p>
            The contract defined by this interface must be fulfilled by the
            calling party to guarantee that the portlet environment will work
            correctly.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <a name="3.2 Container Services"></a><div class="section"><h3>3.2 Container Services</h3>
          <p>
            ContainerServices are a generic plug-in concept for extending the
            core portlet container with additional functionality.
            A ContainerService is defined by an interface, accessed by the
            portlet container and provided by the calling party (mostly
            portal/framework). In some cases the flow goes in the other
            direction, from container to portal. The nature of a service can be
            viewed as a service made available for the portlet container:
            The container needs it to run, but cannot implement the service
            itself.
          </p>
					<p>
            The Container Service concept makes the portlet container
            independent of portal functions so that it can be used by different
            portals and furthermore new services can be plugged in to get a
            richer portlet container experience. A ContainerServiceEnvironment
            describing all services must be created and passed to the portlet
            environment during initialization.

            Container Services can be split into two different categories:

              <li>
                <b>Mandatory Base Services</b>
                <p>ContainerServices that must be provided by the calling party
                so that the portlet container is able to run.</p>

								  <li><b>Factory Manager Service:</b> Factory Service enables
                  the portlet container to get implementation objects through a
                  factory concept.</li>
                  <li><b>Log Service:</b> This interface defines a logging
                  facility.</li>

              <li>
                <b>Optional Base Services</b>
                ContainerServices that can be provided by the calling party,
                but the container can run without it.
                <ul>

          <a name="3.2.1 Information Provider Service"></a><div class="section"><h3>3.2.1 Information Provider Service</h3>
            
              The Information Provider is a callback mechanism for the portlet
              environment into the calling party (mostly framework), to get hold
              of necessary information that can only be known by the portal,
              like hostname and URL generation. To differentiate between the
              scopes of the requested information, the portlet environment
              defines two interfaces: the DynamicInformationProvider and the
              StaticInformationProvider.
            
            
              The DynamicInformationProvider provides request-based information,
              which changes for each request. Consequently a new
              DynamicInformationProvider needs to be passed to the portlet
              environment for each request. Typical information provided by this
              Information Provider is a URL to a portlet. Additional provider
              interfaces retrieved via getter methods of the
              DynamicInformationProvider are PortletURLProvider and
              PortletActionProvider.
            
            
              The StaticInformationProvider on the other hand provides
              non-request-based information, which is constant across all
              requests. Therefore only one StaticInformationProvider needs to be
              provided to the portlet environment (singleton). Typical
              information provided by this Information Provider is the root
              context of the portal. An additional provider interface retrieved
              via a getter method of the StaticInformationProvider is the
              PortalContextProvider that contains further information about the
              portal, which need to be provided to the portlet.
            
            <p>
              Both Information Providers are not actively passed by the calling
              party to the environment. Instead they are made available to the
              portlet environment through the Container Service mechanism
              described in the next section. Basically, the portlet environment
              asks the calling party for an instance of one of the Information
              Providers and the calling party returns the correct Information
              Provider.

          <a name="3.3 Portlet Object Model"></a><div class="section"><h3>3.3 Portlet Object Model</h3>
						<p>The Portlet Object Model interfaces are defined in the package org.apache.pluto.om. These interfaces should be seen as an internal interface that can be used by other components of the portal. The portlet environment only defines the interfaces that are necessary to execute the object model the portal that uses the portlet environment must implement the object model. </p>
						<p>The object model represents the information available on different levels about portlets and the portlet application, like the deployment descriptors and customization data. </p>
						<p>The following definitions are used to represent the different levels of information:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								
									<strong>WebApplicationDefinition</strong> represents the context for the Portlet Application defined in the web.xml deployment descriptor.
							</li>
							<li>
								
									<strong>PortletApplicationDefinition</strong> describes a set (either all or a subset) of portlets that participate all in the same WebApplicationDefinition.
							</li>
							<li>
								
									<strong>PortletApplicationEntity</strong> is an instantiation of a PortletApplicationDefinition that is bound to a portal resource. It contains a set (either all or a subset) of portlets that participate all in the same PortletApplicationDefinition.
							</li>
							<li>
								
									<strong>ServletDefinition</strong> describes the portlet and its initial read-only properties that is not bound to any portal resource.
							</li>
							<li>
								
									<strong>Portlet Definition</strong> basic settings defined in the portlet.xml or set by administrators (read-only for users).
							</li>
							<li>
								
									<strong>Portlet Entity</strong> is a parameterized portlet definition, belonging to a user. 
							</li>
							<li>
								
									<strong>Portlet Window</strong> is part of an aggregation tree that contains the portlet markup. The portlet window has navigational state attached to it.
								
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Figure 3 depicts the relation between the different definitions and their hierarchical structure. The servlet definitions are embedded in the web application definition. From a web application definition several portlet application definitions can be created that may consist of portlet definitions based on the servlet definitions defined in the web application definition. Using the portlet application definition several portlet application entities can be created that include portlet entities that are based on the corresponding portlet definitions. Finally the portlet windows of a portlet entity are linked to their corresponding portlet entity.</p>

						</div>
						<p>The portlet object model represents these different layers allowing the portlet container to access the information layer-based.</p>
						<p>The object model is split into four different sub-packages:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								common
								<p>contains generic interfaces that can be reused</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								window
								<p>contains all interfaces handling with portlet windows</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								entity
								<p>contains all interfaces handling with portlet application entities and portlet entities</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								portlet
								<p>contains all interfaces handling with portlet application definitions and portlet definitions</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								servlet
								<p>contains all interfaces representing the web application definitions and servlet definitions</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>For the implementation of the different artifacts in the object model the model-view-controller pattern is used and for each artifact a read-only interface exists, and if required an interface with the setter methods and the ending Ctrl is provided.</p>
